# Submit Geese

## How can I submit a goose?
To submit a goose, click the button below, type the name and description of the goose you wish to submit, drag in the image of the goose, then press the 'Submit new issue` button. If you are going to submit multiple geese, please specify which filename corresponds to each goose. Your Github username will be credited as the person who submitted, unless you specify otherwise.

## What can I submit?
Submit anything goose-related, as long as it follows the following rules.
* No NSFW content. Any users that submit NSFW content will be banned from interacting with the repository.
* Geese required. If the image does not contain a goose, it will not be accepted.

**I give no guarantee your goose will be accepted. The name and description of the goose may be modified. I run this site, and I decide what gets on it.**

## Why do I use Github issues for goose submission?
Ideally, I would have a button below that allows you to directly upload and send a goose along with a name and description. Unfortunately, this requires the use of server-side scripting, meaning I have to pay for a domain and server. Whilst there are server hosts that provide a domain and web server in their free tier, I have not yet found one that will store data for an extended period of time, meaning I would likely miss submissions. My solution to this is that since the gallery is hosted on github, people can simply submit an issue requesting that a goose can be added.
