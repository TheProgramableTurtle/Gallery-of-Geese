# About the Gallery of Geese

## Why?
My good friend [The Goose Lord](https://github.com/TheProgramableTurtle) has a bit of an obsession with geese. One fine day, he had the idea to create a website known as "The Gallery of Geese". The idea was good, but sadly his webdev knowledge was not. Skip forward several months, I'm on holiday, and bored. With nothing better to do, I took out my laptop, wrote some code, and with the help of somebody with a long name, started compiling some epic images of geese.

## How?
